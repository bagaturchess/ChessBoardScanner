# Overview

This project aims to demonstrate how to extract the chess position in a machine readable format called Forsythâ€“Edwards Notation (FEN) having the 2D picture of the board.
At the moment it supports 4 chess sets: default chess sets from chess.com, lichess.org and chess24.com as well as one set from paper chess book. Of course, the architecture is extensible and different chess sets could be added additionally.

# Advanced technologies solve complex problems
 - Computer Vision (CV) subdomain of Artificial Intelligence: It uses OpenCV as a computer vision library or framework, which helps in extracting the chess board from the image and transforming it to ideal square.
 - Machine Learning (ML) subdomain of Artificial Intelligence: Both libraries or frameworks Deep Netts Community Edition and Deeplearning4j frameworks as a basis for convolutional nueral networks for chess board classification and chess pieces recognition. It uses both ML frameworks in order to demonstrate how to integrate your code with both, but the code works well with them separately as well.

# Credits

This project would not be possible without:
  -  [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
  -  [DeepNetts](https://www.deepnetts.com/)
  -  [Deeplearning4j](https://deeplearning4j.org/)
  -  [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

# Directions for further development
  -  Extend the solution to work with chess diagrams drawn on paper, this will save a lot of positions from old books in computer format.
  -  Add support for additional popular online chess sites, which can be recognized by the program.
  -  Improve board corners detection, besides the currently used algorithms: findChessBoardCorners by build-in function, findChessBoardCorners by Hough lines and findChessBoardCorners by contours.

# Android Application

The code is used productively by this app, which could be found here: https://metatransapps.com/chess-board-scanner-and-analyzer/

# Technical details

If you need technical explanation of the algorithms used, please check this [YoutTube video](https://youtu.be/PS5xAGx89mU)

# Running the program

The project structure is an eclipse based project, which can be directly imported into the Eclipse IDE.
All necessary libraries for Deep Netts and Deeplearning4j are included into the libs folder, but you need to add the OpenCV library version 4.5.1 (java and native parts) and refer them from the project as described here: https://opencv-java-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/01-installing-opencv-for-java.html

The basic main classes are in bagaturchess.scanner root package:
 - RecognitionMain_DeepLearning4J, runs chess position recognition for specified image using DeepLearning4J framework. 
 - RecognitionMain_DeepNetts_ChessPiecesProviderClassifier, runs chess position recognition for specified image using Deep Netts framework.
